Recommended Workflow (for team projects):
If merging unrelated histories feels risky, an alternative and cleaner approach is:

Create a new branch off the existing repository (e.g., main branch).
Copy and paste your local files into this new branch.
Commit and push.
This avoids the unrelated-history problem entirely:

bash
Copier
Modifier
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b clean_branch
# copy your local files manually to this branch
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push -u origin clean_branch
Then merge via Pull Request on GitHub.
